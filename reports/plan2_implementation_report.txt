Plan2 Implementation Complete
=================================================

Date: Wed 29 Oct 2025 13:46:49

Files Created: 18

Components:
  - Data Contract (YAML SSOT)
  - DuckDB + dbt-duckdb (3-stage pipeline)
  - pandera/pytest (Quality gates)
  - Multi-format input (CSV/TSV/JSONL/XLSX/Parquet)
  - Causal safety metrics (Overlap, SMD)
  - PostgreSQL/DuckDB routing (heuristic)
  - Makefile (one-command execution)

Key Formulas:
  Overlap = E[1(0.05 < e(X) < 0.95)]
  SMD_j = (μ_1j - μ_0j) / sqrt((s^2_1j + s^2_0j)/2)

Quality Gates:
  - Overlap ≥ 0.6
  - max|SMD| ≤ 0.1
  - Missing rate ≤ 0.3

Execution:
  cd ciq && make all

Expected Output:
  - ciq/data/staged/staged.parquet
  - ciq/warehouse/warehouse.duckdb
  - ciq/data/processed/causal_ready.parquet
  - ciq/artifacts/overlap_metrics.json
